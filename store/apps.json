    "long_description": "PICAT is a compact, rule-based scripting and modeling language designed for combinatorial search, constraint programming (CP), satisfiability solving (SAT), mixed-integer programming (MIP), planning, natural language processing (NLP) and complex data processing. It combines pattern-matching rules (predicates and functions), imperative conveniences (assignable variables, loops and comprehensions), event-driven actors (action rules and channels) and tabling (memoization and term-sharing). The integrated planner uses tabled, resource-bounded search and is often competitive with ASP and PDDL planners on benchmarks. Picat is suitable for teaching and solving NP-like problems (examples: shortest path, knapsack, n-queens, Sudoku) without hand-coding backtracking. Picatâ€™s C sources are distributed under the Mozilla Public License 2.0 (MPL-2.0). Development is led by Neng-Fa Zhou with community contributions.",
