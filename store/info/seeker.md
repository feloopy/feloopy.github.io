Seeker is a powerful primal solver designed to find optimal and near-optimal solutions fast, making it ideal for real-world modeling and decision-making under time constraints. By prioritizing the best possible solutions over traditional bounds, Seeker excels where legacy solvers fall short.

## Key Advantages

- **Time-Constrained Optimization:** Automatically tunes its search strategy for maximum performance based on specific time limits.
- **Unprecedented Parallelization:** Fully distributed, allowing for massive performance gains when utilizing dozens or even hundreds of workers on a single problem instance.
- **Complex Modeling:** Direct optimization of non-linear, non-convex, and non-differentiable relationships. Prototype extremely fast by deriving KPIs directly, like in a simulation, eliminating the need for linearization or binarization.
- **Multi-Objective Optimization:** Optimize multiple KPIs simultaneously without aggregation, strict hierarchies, or constant trade-off rates. This provides practical solutions, even for infeasible problems.
- **Decision-Making Under Uncertainty:** Built for stochastic optimization. Optimize for expected performance, quantiles, Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR), or risk probability, based on the award-winning work of its creators.

## Proven Results

See concrete examples, including code that runs on Google Colab, on the InsideOpt Webpages. Highlights include:

- A quadratic assignment example where Seeker demonstrated a speedup of over **30x**-**1,000x** compared to others.
- In a pricing and distribution case, Seeker delivered **$186 million more** for the clients.
