LPL combines a readable declarative mathematical language with an algorithmic layer so you can build, manage, and document linear, non-linear, and logical optimization models. It includes a small internal LP solver for quick tests but is designed to call external solvers. It provides a Windows GUI (LPLW) and supports database import and export, plus report generation.

Created by [Tony HÃ¼rlimann](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tony-h%C3%BCrlimann-968774108/) and tracing to his PhD and book: A Structured Language for Modeling Linear Programs, published by Peter Lang in 1987.

It ships with a built-in LP solver and a Tabu search heuristic for small problems and can call many external solvers, including commercial ones like Gurobi, CPLEX, and Xpress, as well as open source solvers such as GLPK, CBC, and others via a flexible solver interface.

Distribution is via MatMod, with a free demo package plus time-limited Academic Professional and Enterprise license keys you can obtain from MatMod.
