COPT is a commercial, production-grade optimization solver developed by Cardinal Operations. The company was founded around 2016 by [Xiaoqu Luo](https://www.linkedin.com/in/k-tafakkori/overlay/create-post/#), [Dongdong Ge](https://www.linkedin.com/in/k-tafakkori/overlay/create-post/#), [Zizhuo Wang](https://www.linkedin.com/in/k-tafakkori/overlay/create-post/#), and Xi Wang.

COPT supports linear programming (LP), mixed-integer programming (MIP), quadratic programming (QP), including mixed-integer QP, second-order cone programming (SOCP), including mixed-integer SOCP, semidefinite programming (SDP), and exponential/power-cone models, with mixed-integer variants where applicable.

COPT also provides graphics processing unit (GPU) acceleration for selected linear solvers, implementing a GPU first-order linear method plus a GPU barrier fallback; GPU use requires NVIDIAâ€™s Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA) and a compatible GPU, otherwise COPT falls back to CPU-only operation.

For integration and deployment, COPT publishes official language bindings and low-level APIs, provides wheels and binaries for major platforms, and supports floating, server, and cluster licensing. Free evaluation downloads and community trial arrangements are available for testing; commercial licensing is required for production deployments.
